Ever since I got into recording music (almost 20 years ago now!) I've had this really bad habit of spending hours recording music only to delete everything at the end because I just was not satisfied with it. Well, just the other day I had a random thought that I need to stop doing that and actually put together some finished work. I need to stop chasing perfection with my recordings and be content with what I'm able to accomplish given my very limited schedule.  I'm busier than ever before and if I don't make some course adjustments I may not get myself to record another song for years and years.  And that would be extremely unfortunate given how much I enjoy playing and recording music.

I'm going to attempt to post a new song at least once a month.

Let's do this.
