I've been messing around with recording and mixing this song for about a week now and really wanted to get it all done during my train ride into the office this morning... so I ended up mixing it using just my AKG K240 headphones. I'll have to listen to it through my monitors later this week. Curious to see how it will end up sounding when listening to it
