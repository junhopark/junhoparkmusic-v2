I've been keeping track of my worship sets since April of 2004 and I thought that perhaps other worship leaders might find my worship set lists helpful to refer to. So here it is:

[https://github.com/junhopark/worship-set-list](https://github.com/junhopark/worship-set-list)

As to why I decided to host it on GitHub:
* I wanted to maintain my worship sets in a plaintext format & markdown is great
* I felt that being able to version control it might come in handy at some point in the future

At the moment, I only have it going back as far as 2/4/2018. I plan on adding older sets to the list at some point in the future AND will be keeping it up to date going forward.
