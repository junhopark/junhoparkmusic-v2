This is a song that's sung by Planetshakers.  The mix consists of primary vocal, backing vocal, electric guitar (using stock Studio One plugins for the guitar FX), bass, keyboard & drums (both via MIDI).  I hadn't touched my bass and electric guitar in about 2 years and it felt good to pull them out of the cases they were sitting in.
