Here's At the Cross by Chris Tomlin.  The mix consists of primary vocal, backing vocal, 2 tracks of acoustic guitar (one strumming and one fingerpicking), keyboard, cajon, and egg shaker.  I was able to get latency down to about 3 milliseconds, which enabled me to track with effects turned on and that certainly helped me out, especially when it came to recording vocals.
