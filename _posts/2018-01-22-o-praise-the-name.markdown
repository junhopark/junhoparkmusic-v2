First recorded song in the new year! I especially love the lyrics to this song & the vivid imagery of Jesus and his blood that he spilled for us, the empty tomb, a glimpse of his return, and those whose "gaze [will be] transfixed on Jesus' face". Originally recorded in B and then I realized that I wasn't able to hit the high note on the harmony in verse 3... so then I had to take it down half step to Bb.
